The attached app.py file contains a code who's main task was to o build a FastAPI in Python to handle GET requests on three routes: 
/name, 
/occupation,
/address.

The application utilizes a list of dictionaries with sample data for different individuals, each containing a person's name, occupation, and address.

 Three route handlers are defined to extract and return the respective data from the list. 
 
 When a GET request is made to /name, the API returns a list of all names; for /occupation, it returns a list of all occupations; and for /address, it returns a list of all addresses.
